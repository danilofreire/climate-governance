This Dataverse repository contains all necessary information to replicate the results presented in "Institutional Design and Elite Support for Climate Policies: Evidence from Latin American Countries", by Danilo Freire, Umberto Mignozzetti, and David Skarbek. Please refer to the Supplementary Materials for additional estimations.

A copy of the files included here are also available at <https://github.com/danilofreire/climate-governance>. Please feel free to contact us at [danilofreire@gmail.com](mailto:danilofreire@gmail.com) or [umberto.mig@fgv.br](mailto:umberto.mig@fgv.br) if you have any questions regarding the replication materials.

The files in this repository are:

* `freire-mignozzetti-skarbek.RData` - the data set we used in our models.
* `paper.R` - R code that replicates all figures included in the main article.
* `references.bib` - list of references we cite in the paper and the supplementary material.
* `supplementary-material-climate-policy.pdf` - supplementary materials in pdf format. 
* `supplementary-material-climate-policy.Rmd` - supplementary materials in RMarkdown format. The file includes the complete code we used in all models as well as the reporting standards recommended by the APSA Organized Section on Experimental Research. Please note that we created a custom function to plot the AMCE models. It is available in the beginning of the file. The function is not required for the statistical estimations.
* `template.latex` - LaTeX template we used to create the pdf version of the supplementary material.

Analysis in R were run on R version 4.0.0 (2020-04-24 - "Arbor Day") on MacOS 10.14.6. The code files include the output of the `sessionInfo()` command, which lists the versions of all R packages we used in the estimations.
