> **Abstract**: Climate change mitigation requires global scale governance, but it remains unclear which institutional arrangements maximise the support for collective environmental policies. In this paper, we run a conjoint experiment with elite members of 10 Latin American countries and ask respondents to evaluate institutional designs randomly drawn from a pool of 6,000 possible climate change agreements. We find that institutional features have a substantial effect on support for climate change mitigation treaties. In general, Latin American elites prefer multilevel solutions with flexible punishment schemes to tackle global warming, but there is considerable heterogeneity across countries and elite types. Our results identify possible challenges in crafting regional climate mitigation policies and offer new insights about how to integrate interventions at the local and international levels.
