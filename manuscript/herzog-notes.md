Comments from Herzog that we need to address
============================================

If I were a reviewer, I would say there is work to do here on framing, generalizabilty, and more clearly identifying the theoretical contribution. The data visualization is good but it could be a little easier to make comparisons between groups of elites and between countries.

1.  There are some instances of British Englsh, starting with maximise (vs. mazimize) in the abstract. Given how insular U.S. political science is, I would make sure to change it all to American English before submitting it anywhere in the states, like JEPs.

_Answer_: **DONE** ✅

2. I think there is a disconnect here in the intro:

  - The intro gives stats from public opinion polls.
  - Then you survey various elites.

It is unclear if elite opinion matches public opinion. And it is unclear if the types of elites you are surveying have control over the policy process. If you did an elite survey in the United States, people will tell you all about their preferences on climate change mitigation, but this matters very little when industry and Trump people are calling the shots.

I think you need to play some defense, at least cite a few things about the role and importance of elites in climate change policy, etc. It will not be perfect, but it will help. 

I know this is hinted at (possible group differences) in the conclusion, but I think a little more work on the importance and relevants of elites here could go along way.

3. The abstract talks about regional climate change mitigation agreements, which would be a good focus since you make note that little research has been done in Latin America. But all of the lit and agreements referenced in here seem to be global. If Latin American countries think one way, and those from the "developed" world think otherwise, you might just be deadlocked in negotiations or they could be overpowered. Then I am left wondering how you reconcile these positions. I think the regional aspect is probably your best shot, or to discuss how the perspective you mention might interact specifically with the perspectives voiced in the lit on the developed world. Are there similiaries or differences, etc., what might happen in overall negotiations...

4. It would be good to know if you have any data about how this might generalize beyond Latin America given your framing. If we want to think about regional agreements, or the developing world in particular, it would be useful to know how broad the application of these findings can be. Otherwise, you might get stuck at a regional journal. That would not be the worst thing, but I have a feeling you are interested in a broad puzzle.

5. Your probably want to note somewhere how your design maximizes power given your sample size. It is clear that is does, of course, but worth saying that due to some idiots out there. Although, for JEPs you do not need to.

_Answer_: **DONE** ✅

6. Some of the data visualization here is tough. I really had to stare at Figure 3 for a long time to get anything from it. It might be worth having an appendix where you have a bunch of single covariate-specific graphs, or those for subsections (e.g., punishments). Likewise, I might make Figure 4 into one overall graph and then make each of the four different groups a different color so we can more directly observe the comparison. That is at least me preference for observing diff-in-means...

7. I am not totally sold that you have spelled out the contribution to local and international interventions you mentioned in the abstract.
